A project looking at the impact school type, size, and funding have on student success.

tl;dr 

More spending does not mean a higher percentage of students passing reading and math; however there is likley  more study to be done on the ideal amount spent per student. Other factors are size and charter status.

Related, the largest schools have the lowest percent of students passing reading and math; put another way, the smaller the school, the higher the percentage of students passing both math and reading.

Generally, charter schools, which are smaller are more likely to have a higher percentage of students passing both reading and math, by 20 percentage points on average.
